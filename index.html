      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Akash Missile represents India’s ambition to achieve self-reliance in strategic defense systems. Designed as a shield against aerial threats, it plays a vital role in protecting high-value military assets and infrastructure from enemy aircraft, missiles, and unmanned aerial systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Akash was envisioned to close the gap between short-range tactical defenses and long-range strategic deterrence. By empowering the armed forces with mobile, multi-target air defense capability, it strengthens India’s layered missile defense doctrine and provides coverage for both static bases and dynamic formations.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets Akash apart is not just its missile, but the complete system — integrating surveillance, tracking, fire control, and engagement in a seamless loop. Built entirely with indigenous technologies, Akash reflects India's growing technological maturity in the defense sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its inception, the system has continually evolved to address emerging aerial threats, from legacy aircraft to next-generation stealth platforms and high-speed UAVs. As a result, Akash has become more than a missile — it's a platform for innovation, modernization, and strategic autonomy.

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>The Akash-NG missile system begins its engagement process with target detection using the indigenously developed Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) Multifunction Radar (MFR). Unlike passive radars, AESA enables:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>High refresh rate scanning for faster detection cycles</li>
              <li>Simultaneous multi-target detection and tracking</li>
              <li>Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) capability</li>
              <li>X-band operation for high-resolution tracking of low-RCS targets</li>
              <li>Its look-down/shoot-down capability enables tracking of low-flying aircraft despite ground clutter interference.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Upon identifying a potential threat (within 80–100 km range), the radar passes tracking information to the Fire Control System (FCS).</p>

              <li>Real-time trajectory computation using radar tracking data and engagement geometry</li>
              <li>Comprehensive pre-launch diagnostics and health status verification of the missile</li>

              <li>The proximity fuse triggers the warhead, initiating detonation</li>
              <li>It disperses thousands of high-density, pre-fragmented metal shards at hypersonic speeds</li>

      <h4>📈 2. Attitude Adjustment & Pitch-Over</h4>
      <p>
        Using onboard gyros and Inertial Navigation System (INS), the missile performs a controlled pitch-over maneuver toward the predicted intercept point.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="trajectory-phase">
      <h4>🧭 3. Mid-Course Guidance</h4>
      <p>
        During this phase, ground-based radar data and onboard INS provide updated navigation commands via secure datalink, allowing real-time trajectory corrections.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="trajectory-phase">
      <h4>🎯 4. Terminal Homing</h4>
      <p>
        The onboard Active Radar Seeker activates in the final 10–15 km, autonomously locking onto the target and adjusting the flight path for a direct hit using proportional navigation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="trajectory-phase">
      <h4>💥 5. Intercept & Detonation</h4>
      <p>
        At proximity (15–30 m), the proximity fuse activates, detonating the warhead and dispersing high-velocity fragments to neutralize even highly maneuverable or stealth targets.
