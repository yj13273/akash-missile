  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The Akash Missile represents India’s ambition to achieve self-reliance in strategic defense systems. Designed as a shield against aerial threats, it plays a vital role in protecting high-value military assets and infrastructure from enemy aircraft, missiles, and unmanned aerial systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Akash was envisioned to close the gap between short-range tactical defenses and long-range strategic deterrence. By empowering the armed forces with mobile, multi-target air defense capability, it strengthens India’s layered missile defense doctrine and provides coverage for both static bases and dynamic formations.
  </p>
  <p>
    What sets Akash apart is not just its missile, but the complete system — integrating surveillance, tracking, fire control, and engagement in a seamless loop. Built entirely with indigenous technologies, Akash reflects India's growing technological maturity in the defense sector.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since its inception, the system has continually evolved to address emerging aerial threats, from legacy aircraft to next-generation stealth platforms and high-speed UAVs. As a result, Akash has become more than a missile — it's a platform for innovation, modernization, and strategic autonomy.

  <h2>Akash Missile Variants</h2>
  <p>The Akash missile family has evolved through multiple upgrades, each version improving upon range, precision, and operational flexibility to address modern aerial threats.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="mk1.html" target="_blank">Akash Mk-I:</a></strong>
      The original version featuring a command-guided interception system and a range of up to 30 km. Inducted into the Indian Air Force and Army.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="1s.html" target="_blank">Akash-1S:</a></strong>
      An improved version equipped with an indigenous seeker, enhancing accuracy against small and agile aerial targets like cruise missiles and drones.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="prime.html" target="_blank">Akash Prime:</a></strong>
      Incorporates a refined RF seeker and improved performance in extreme weather and altitude, making it effective against low-altitude threats.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="ng.html" target="_blank">Akash-NG:</a></strong>
      The next-generation system with a longer range (up to 80 km), AESA radar, canister launch, and multiple target engagement capabilities.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

    <section id="features" class="section">
      <h2>Key Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> Up to 30 km</li>
        <li><strong>Altitude:</strong> Up to 18 km</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Mach 2.5–3.0</li>
        <li><strong>Warhead:</strong> 60 kg HE fragmentation</li>
        <li><strong>Guidance:</strong> Ground command via Rajendra Radar</li>
        <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Mounted on wheeled & tracked vehicles</li>
        <li><strong>Variants:</strong> Akash, Akash-1S, Akash-NG</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="working" class="section">
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        Akash uses command guidance, where radar tracks both target and missile. Ground systems send real-time corrections to guide the missile.
        A proximity fuse detonates near the target, maximizing hit probability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="trajectory" class="section">
      <h2>Missile Trajectory</h2>
      <p>
        The Akash missile follows a semi-ballistic path. It ascends post-launch, then uses continuous radar updates to adjust its flight mid-air until impact.
